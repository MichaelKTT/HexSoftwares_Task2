# Iris Dataset – Data Exploration Project
📌## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring and understanding the structure of the Iris dataset using Python.
The objective is to perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and check the data quality before building any machine learning model.

📊 Dataset Description

The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning.

Dataset characteristics:

150 samples

4 numerical features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

3 flower species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

The dataset was loaded using Seaborn.

🎯 Project Objectives

The main tasks of this project were:

Load the Iris dataset.

Explore the structure of the data.

Check for missing values.

Visualize the distribution of each feature.

⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

The dataset was loaded using the Seaborn library.

The first rows of the dataset were inspected.

2. Data Structure Exploration

Checked the dataset shape.

Examined data types.

Generated statistical summaries.

3. Missing Value Check

Verified if any missing values existed in the dataset.

Result: No missing values were found.

4. Data Visualization

The following visualizations were created:

Histograms

Show the distribution of each feature.

Help identify spread and skewness.

Boxplots

Show the range and outliers in each feature.

Compare distributions across features.

Pairplot

Shows relationships between features.

Helps visualize class separation.

🔍 Key Observations

The Setosa species is clearly separated from the other two species.

Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap.

Petal length and petal width are the most important features for distinguishing species.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Seaborn
